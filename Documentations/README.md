## Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers, particularly in regions like Anantapur, face significant challenges including limited access to scientific advice, opaque supply chains, and unfair pricing. This leads to reduced profitability and high post-harvest losses. Simultaneously, corporate buyers struggle with inconsistent quality and a lack of traceability needed to meet modern ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) standards.
